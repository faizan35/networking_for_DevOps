# 10.1 Using Git for Network Configuration Version Control

**Best Practices for Managing Network Changes:**

1.  **Version Control Basics:**

    - Utilize a version control system (VCS) like Git to track changes to network configurations.
    - Commit changes regularly, providing a history of modifications.

2.  **Repository Structure:**

    - Organize the repository to reflect the network infrastructure's logical structure.
    - Use directories for different components (routers, switches, firewalls).

3.  **Branching Strategy:**

    - Implement a branching strategy to separate development, testing, and production configurations.
    - Create branches for feature development and bug fixes.

4.  **Commit Messages:**

    - Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
    - Include information about the purpose of the change and any relevant details.

5.  **Code Review:**

    - Encourage code reviews for network configurations.
    - Review changes before merging them into the main branch.

6.  **Automated Testing:**

    - Implement automated testing of network configurations.
    - Use tools to validate configurations and detect potential issues.

7.  **Documentation:**

    - Maintain documentation alongside configurations.
    - Include information about network topology, device configurations, and change history.
