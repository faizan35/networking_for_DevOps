# 2.2 Subnetting

## 2.2.1 Introduction to Subnetting

**Subnetting Involves dividing the <u>host portion</u> of IP address to create subnets.**

- Subnetting divides a large network into smaller, efficient subnetworks, preventing IP address wastage.
- Smaller subnets reduce broadcast domains, leading to improved network performance.
- It provides scalability, allowing for easy expansion without reconfiguring the entire network.

### Subnet Mask

- A subnet mask separates an IP address into network and host portions.
- Example: For a Class C address (e.g., 192.168.1.0), a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 represents a 24-bit network mask.

#### Subnet Mask with Classes:

1.  **Class A:**

    - **Range:** 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255
    - **Format:** N.H.H.H (Network.Host.Host.Host)
    - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.0.0.0

2.  **Class B:**

    - **Range:** 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
    - **Format:** N.N.H.H
    - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.255.0.0

3.  **Class C:**

    - **Range:** 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
    - **Format:** N.N.N.H
    - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0

> **Note :-** CIDR is more efficient way to subnet IP addresses compared to the older class-based addressing system.

## 2.2.2 CIDR Notation

#### Understanding CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):

- Represents IP addresses and their associated routing prefix.
- **Format:** **IP_address/prefix_length**
- **Example:** 192.168.1.0/24 denotes a 24-bit network mask.
- Enables more flexible allocation of IP addresses compared to traditional class-based addressing.

#### **Steps in Subnetting:**

1.  **Determine the Original CIDR:**

    - Original CIDR: `192.168.10.0/24`

2.  **Decide on the Number of Subnets Needed:**

    - Let's say we want to create **4 subnets**.

3.  **Calculate the New Subnet Mask Length:**

    - Increasing the subnet mask length allows for the creation of more subnets within a given IP address space.

    - Formula for calculating the **number of subnets**.

      ```txt
      2^n >= Number of Subnets.
      ```

      - `n` = number of additional bits required.

    - We know the number of subnet = 4, So `2^2 = 4`.

    - To create 4 subnets, you need at least **2 bits**.

    - So, the new subnet mask length
    - **`/24 (original) + 2 (for subnets) = /26`**

    - **Explanation:**
      - With 1 bit, you have 2 possible values (0 and 1).
      - With 2 bits, you have 2^2 = 4 possible values (00, 01, 10, 11).
      - With 3 bits, you have 2^3 = 8 possible values (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111).
      - And so on.

4.  **Identify Subnet Ranges:**

    - `192.168.10.0` is a Class C IP, traditionally with the format "N.N.N.H" (8 bits for network, 8 bits for network, 8 bits for network, 8 bits for hosts).
    - `2^N = possible values` , N = no of Host bits
    - You have N = 8 (host bits), and 2^8 = 256 possible values.
    - Since you are creating 4 subnets, each subnet will have 256 / 4 = 64 possible values.
    - Start with `192.168.10.0` and increment by 64 for each subsequent subnet.
    - Subnet 1: `192.168.10.0/26`
    - Subnet 2: `192.168.10.64/26`
    - Subnet 3: `192.168.10.128/26`
    - Subnet 4: `192.168.10.192/26`

5.  **Determine Host Ranges in Each Subnet:**

    - The usable host addresses in each subnet are from the range `1` to `62`.
      - Subnet 1: `192.168.10.1` to `192.168.10.62`
      - Subnet 2: `192.168.10.65` to `192.168.10.126`
      - Subnet 3: `192.168.10.129` to `192.168.10.190`
      - Subnet 4: `192.168.10.193` to `192.168.10.254`

    **Explanation:**

    - In each subnet, **subtracting 2 from the total number of addresses** accounts for the **network and broadcast addresses**. This ensures that these addresses are reserved and not used for individual hosts.
    - The first usable address in each subnet starts after the network address, and the last usable address is just before the broadcast address.

6.  **Summary:**

    - **Subnet 1:**

      - Network Address: `192.168.10.0/26`
      - Usable Host Range: `192.168.10.1` to `192.168.10.62`
      - Broadcast Address: `192.168.10.63`

    - **Subnet 2:**

      - Network Address: `192.168.10.64/26`
      - Usable Host Range: `192.168.10.65` to `192.168.10.126`
      - Broadcast Address: `192.168.10.127`

    - **Subnet 3:**

      - Network Address: `192.168.10.128/26`
      - Usable Host Range: `192.168.10.129` to `192.168.10.190`
      - Broadcast Address: `192.168.10.191`

    - **Subnet 4:**

      - Network Address: `192.168.10.192/26`
      - Usable Host Range: `192.168.10.193` to `192.168.10.254`
      - Broadcast Address: `192.168.10.255`
