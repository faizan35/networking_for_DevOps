# 7.3 Advanced Networking Concepts and Connectivity

## Docker Swarm

1. Docker Swarm is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it suitable for smaller projects.
2. It seamlessly integrates with the broader Docker ecosystem, leveraging existing Docker knowledge and configurations.

**Equivalent Tasks with Kubernetes:**

1. Kubernetes offers advanced features and a robust ecosystem, making it suitable for complex and large-scale applications.
2. Kubernetes is the industry standard for **container orchestration**, favored for scalability, flexibility, and widespread adoption. Organizations prefer it for diverse environments, from on-premises to the cloud.

### **Introduction to Overlay Networks in Docker:**

- Overlay networks are used for communication between containers running on different Docker hosts in a swarm.
- Essential for building distributed applications that span multiple machines.
- Created using the `docker network create` command with the `--driver overlay` option.

### **Container DNS Resolution and Service Discovery:**

- Docker provides automatic DNS resolution for container names within the same network.
- Containers can discover and communicate with each other using service names.
- This simplifies service discovery in dynamic containerized environments.

### **Port Mapping and Configuring External Connectivity:**

- Map container ports to host ports to enable external access.
- Use the `-p` or `--publish` option during container creation:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name web_app my_web_app_image
  ```

- This maps port 80 in the container to port 8080 on the host.

### **Utilizing the Host Network Mode for Direct Host Stack Access:**

- Containers can use the host's network stack, bypassing network isolation.
- Achieved using the `--network host` option during container creation:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --network host --name web_server my_web_image
  ```

- Useful when containers need direct access to the host's network interfaces.

### Example Scenario:

Let's create an overlay network named "my_overlay_network" and deploy two services, "web_service" and "database_service," across multiple Docker hosts in a swarm.

```bash
# Initialize Docker swarm on the manager node
docker swarm init
```

```bash
# Join worker nodes to the swarm (output from "docker swarm init" command)
docker swarm join --token <worker-token> <manager-ip>
```

```bash
# Create an overlay network
docker network create --driver overlay my_overlay_network
```

```bash
# Deploy a web service to the overlay network
docker service create --name web_service --network my_overlay_network my_web_image
```

```bash
# Deploy a database service to the overlay network
docker service create --name database_service --network my_overlay_network my_database_image
```

Containers in the "my_overlay_network" can communicate across multiple hosts within the swarm. DNS resolution allows services to discover each other by name.
