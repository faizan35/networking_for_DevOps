# 1.5. MAC Addressing

## MAC (Media Access Control) Addresses

- MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication on the physical network segment.
- **Format:** 48-bit address typically displayed as six pairs of hexadecimal digits (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).

**Structure:**

- **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier):** The first 24 bits (first 3 pairs) identify the manufacturer.
- **NIC (Network Interface Controller):** The last 24 bits (last 3 pairs) uniquely identify the network device.

**Purpose:**

- Ensures that each device on a local network can be uniquely identified.
- Used for communication within the same network segment or broadcast domain.

**Example:**

- `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
  - `00:1A:2B` (OUI)
  - `3C:4D:5E` (NIC)

#### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

- ARP is a protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC address on a local network.
- **Purpose:** Enables devices to locate each other on the same local network.

**How ARP Works:**

1. **ARP Request:**
   - Device A wants to communicate with Device B but only knows Device B’s IP address.
   - Device A broadcasts an ARP request to all devices on the local network, asking, "Who has this IP address?"
2. **ARP Reply:**

   - Device B recognizes its own IP address in the ARP request.
   - Device B sends an ARP reply directly to Device A, providing its MAC address.

3. **Communication:**
   - Device A stores Device B’s MAC address in its ARP table/cache.
   - Device A can now communicate directly with Device B using the MAC address.

**Example:**

- Device A (IP: 192.168.1.2) wants to communicate with Device B (IP: 192.168.1.3).
- Device A broadcasts ARP request: "Who has 192.168.1.3?"
- Device B responds: "192.168.1.3 is at 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E."
- Device A updates its ARP table and communicates with Device B using the MAC address.

### Quick Reference

#### MAC Address

- **Unique Identifier:** For network interfaces.
- **Format:** 48-bit (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).
- **Structure:** OUI (first 3 pairs) + NIC (last 3 pairs).

#### ARP

- **Purpose:** Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.
- **Process:**
  1. **ARP Request:** "Who has IP x.x.x.x?"
  2. **ARP Reply:** "IP x.x.x.x is at MAC xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx."
- **Example:** Device A (IP: 192.168.1.2) -> Device B (IP: 192.168.1.3) -> MAC address exchange.
