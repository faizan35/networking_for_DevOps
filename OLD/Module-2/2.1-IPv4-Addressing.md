# 2.1 IPv4 Addressing

## 2.1.1 IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

- IPv4 is a **communication protocol** used to identify and locate devices on a network.
- It's a core component of the Internet Protocol suite, operating at the network layer.
- IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numerical labels, expressed in dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

#### **Functions of IPv4:**

1.  **Unique Addressing:** Provides a unique address to each device on a network for identification.
2.  **Routing:** Facilitates the routing of data packets between devices across interconnected networks.

## 2.1.2 Binary Representation of IPv4 Addresses

- In binary, these 32 bits are grouped into four octets (each octet being 8 bits) and represented using dotted-decimal notation.

#### Converting Decimal to Binary:

- To convert a decimal IPv4 address to binary, each decimal number in the dotted-decimal format is converted to its 8-bit binary representation.

**Example:**

- Convert the IPv4 address 192.168.1.1 to Binary.
- Take help from => [Decimal to Binary converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html)
- In binary, this address would be represented as:

  - 192 = 11000000
  - 168 = 10101000
  - 1 = 1
  - 1 = 1

- There are 8 bit space so, add **Zero** in front.
- **Binary representation => 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001**

#### Converting Binary to Decimal:

- The reverse process involves converting each 8-bit binary number back to its decimal form.
- For instance, the binary 11000000 is equal to 192 in decimal.

## 2.1.3 Classes of IP Addresses (A, B, C)

#### IPv4 Address Classes:

- IPv4 addresses are categorized into classes, denoted by letters A, B, C, D, and E.
- Classes A, B, and C are primarily used for host addressing in networks.

#### Classes A, B, C Overview:

1.  **Class A:**

    - **Range:** 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255
    - **Format:** N.H.H.H (Network.Host.Host.Host)
    - **Example:** 10.0.0.1
    - **Subnet Mask:** 255.0.0.0 (or /8 in CIDR notation).
    - **Notes:** Intended for large networks with a massive number of hosts.

2.  **Class B:**

    - **Range:** 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
    - **Format:** N.N.H.H
    - **Example:** 172.16.0.1
    - **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.0.0 (or /16 in CIDR notation).
    - **Notes:** Suitable for medium-sized networks.

3.  **Class C:**

    - **Range:** 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
    - **Format:** N.N.N.H
    - **Example:** 192.168.1.1
    - **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0 (or /24 in CIDR notation).
    - **Notes:** Intended for smaller networks with a limited number of hosts.

#### How a person thinks of a IP Address

1.  **Identifying IP Address Class:**

    - When you look at an IP address, you can tell its class (A, B, or C) based on the range of the first octet.
    - Now you know how much is network portion and host portion. (done by **subnet mask**)

2.  **Network Portion:**

    - Identifies the network to which a device belongs.
    - Helps routers route data to the correct network.

3.  **Host Portion:**

    - Identifies a specific device within a network.
    - Can be further subdivided for more efficient organization through techniques like **subnetting**.

4.  **Subnetting:** Involves dividing the **host portion** to create subnets.

So, after looking at an IP address:

- The class tells you how it's structured (network vs. host portions).
- The network portion tells you what network the device is on.
- The host portion tells you which specific device in that network.

## 2.1.4 Private vs. Public IP Addresses

#### Private IP Addresses:

- Reserved for use within private networks (e.g., within a home or business).
- Not directly routable on the public internet.
- Defined by specific address ranges, such as:
  - Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
  - Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
  - Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

**Private Address Use Cases:**

- Commonly used for internal network devices.
- Provides a level of address space abstraction within an organization.
- Enables multiple organizations to use the same private address ranges without conflict.

#### Public IP Addresses:

- Routable over the internet and used for global communication.
- Unique and globally identifiable.
- Allocated by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and organizations.

**Public Address Use Cases:**

- Necessary for devices that need direct communication over the internet.
- Used by servers, websites, and other publicly accessible resources.

#### Network Address Translation (NAT):

- Often, private addresses are translated to a single public address when accessing the internet.
- NAT allows multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address.

#### Addressing Limitations and NAT:

**Address Shortage:**

- The total number of available public IPv4 addresses is limited, leading to address shortages.
- Private addressing, combined with NAT, helps mitigate this limitation.

**NAT Benefits:**

- Preserves public IP addresses by allowing multiple devices to share a single public address.
- Enhances network security by hiding internal network structure.
