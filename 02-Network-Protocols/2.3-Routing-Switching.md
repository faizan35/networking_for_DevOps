# 2.3. Routing and Switching

## Routing

### Basics of Routing

- Routing is the process of directing data packets between different networks to ensure that data reaches its intended destination.
- This is achieved by making decisions based on logical addresses (such as IP addresses).
- Routers are the devices that perform routing functions.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Router:**

    - A networking device that operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
    - Connects different networks and forwards data packets between them.
    - Uses **routing tables** to determine the best path for data transmission.

2.  **Routing:**

    - The process of selecting the optimal path for data to travel from the source to the destination.
    - Involves making decisions based on logical addressing (IP addresses) rather than physical addresses (MAC addresses).

### Routing Tables and How They Work

#### **Routing Table:**

- A routing table is a data structure stored in a router that contains information about known routes to reach specific networks or destinations.

**Components of a Routing Table:**

1.  **Network Address:**

    - Identifies the destination network or host.

2.  **Next-Hop Router:**

    - Specifies the router or next-hop interface to which the data packet should be forwarded.

3.  **Metric:**

    - Represents the cost or distance associated with a particular route.
    - The lower the metric, the more preferred the route.

#### **How Routing Tables Work:**

1.  **Packet Arrival:**

    - When a router receives a data packet, it checks the destination IP address of the packet.

2.  **Routing Table Lookup:**

    - The router looks up the destination IP address in its routing table to find the appropriate route.

3.  **Next-Hop Determination:**

    - The routing table provides information about the next-hop router or interface for forwarding the packet.

4.  **Forwarding the Packet:**

    - The router forwards the packet to the determined next-hop router or interface.

#### **Static vs. Dynamic Routing:**

1.  **Static Routing:**

    - **Manual Configuration:**
      - Routes are manually configured by a network administrator.
    - **Use Case:**
      - Suitable for small networks with a relatively stable topology.
    - **Advantages:**
      - Simple to set up.
    - **Disadvantages:**
      - Requires manual intervention for updates.

2.  **Dynamic Routing:**

    - **Automated Configuration:**
      - Routers use routing protocols to exchange information and dynamically update routing tables.
    - **Use Case:**
      - Suitable for larger networks with dynamic changes in topology.
    - **Advantages:**
      - Adapts to changes in network topology.
    - **Disadvantages:**
      - More complex to set up compared to static routing.

## Common Routing Protocols

**OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):**

- **Type:** Link-state routing protocol.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Finds the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
  - Fast convergence and scalability.
  - Hierarchical design with areas.
- **Use Case:** Large enterprise networks.

**BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):**

- **Type:** Path-vector routing protocol.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Manages how packets are routed across the internet through different autonomous systems (AS).
  - Policy-based routing.
  - Supports very large networks.
- **Use Case:** Internet service providers (ISPs) and large networks.

**RIP (Routing Information Protocol):**

- **Type:** Distance-vector routing protocol.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Uses hop count as the metric.
  - Simple but limited to small networks.
  - Slow convergence.
- **Use Case:** Small, simple networks.

### Quick Reference

#### Routers vs. Switches

- **Routers:**

  - Connect different networks.
  - Operate at Layer 3.
  - Direct data packets across networks.

- **Switches:**
  - Connect devices within the same network.
  - Operate at Layer 2 (or Layer 3 for some).
  - Manage data traffic within a network.

#### Static vs. Dynamic Routing

- **Static Routing:**

  - Manually configured.
  - Simple, secure, not scalable.
  - Use in small networks.

- **Dynamic Routing:**
  - Automatically adjusts.
  - Scalable, flexible, complex.
  - Use in large networks.

#### Common Routing Protocols

- **OSPF:**

  - Link-state.
  - Fast, scalable, hierarchical.
  - Large enterprise networks.

- **BGP:**

  - Path-vector.
  - Internet-wide routing, policy-based.
  - ISPs, large networks.

- **RIP:**
  - Distance-vector.
  - Simple, limited, slow convergence.
  - Small networks.

## Switching

#### Understanding Switches and Their Role

**Switch:**

- A switch is a network device that operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.
- Its **primary function is to forward data frames based on MAC addresses**.
- Switches are commonly used in local area networks (LANs) to connect devices within the same network segment.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **MAC Address Learning:**

    - Switches learn the MAC addresses of connected devices by examining the source address of incoming frames.
    - This information is then stored in the switch's MAC address table.

2.  **MAC Address Table:**

    - A table maintained by the switch that maps MAC addresses to the corresponding switch ports.
    - Helps the switch make forwarding decisions based on destination MAC addresses.

3.  **Frame Forwarding:**

    - When a switch receives a data frame, it checks the destination MAC address in its MAC address table.
    - If the destination address is known, the switch forwards the frame only to the port where the destination device is located.
    - If the destination address is unknown, the switch broadcasts the frame to all ports except the source port.

#### VLANs and Their Importance in Modern Networks

**VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network):**

- A VLAN is a logical grouping of devices within the same physical network but logically segmented to improve network efficiency, security, and management.

**Importance of VLANs:**

1.  **Efficiency:**

    - Reduces broadcast domains, limiting the scope of broadcast traffic.
    - Enhances network performance by isolating broadcast traffic within VLANs.

2.  **Security:**

    - Isolates traffic between different VLANs, adding a layer of security.
    - Devices in one VLAN cannot directly communicate with devices in another VLAN without the use of routing.

3.  **Flexibility:**

    - Simplifies network management by grouping devices logically rather than physically.
    - Changes to VLAN assignments can be made in software without physically moving devices or rewiring.

4.  **Scalability:**

    - Easier to scale and manage as the network grows.
    - Allows for logical segmentation of a large network into smaller, more manageable segments.
