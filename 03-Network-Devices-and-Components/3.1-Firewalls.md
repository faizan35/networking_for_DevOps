# 3.1. Firewalls

## What is a Firewall?

A firewall is a security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted network and untrusted networks, such as the internet.

## How Firewalls Work?

Firewalls inspect packets of data as they attempt to pass through the network, allowing or blocking them based on configured rules. These rules can be based on various criteria, including IP addresses, ports, protocols, and packet content.

## Types of Firewalls

1. **Network-Based Firewalls:**

   - **Definition:** These firewalls are typically hardware devices placed at the boundary of a network.
   - **Function:** Protects the entire network by filtering traffic between networks.
   - **Use Case:** Protecting internal corporate networks from external threats.

2. **Host-Based Firewalls:**
   - **Definition:** These firewalls are software applications installed on individual servers or computers.
   - **Function:** Protects a single device by controlling network traffic to and from that device.
   - **Use Case:** Providing additional security for individual devices, particularly servers.

## Firewall Rules and Configurations

- **Rules:** Firewalls use rules to determine whether to allow or block traffic. Rules are defined based on:
  - **IP Addresses:** Specify allowed or blocked IP addresses.
  - **Ports:** Define which ports are open or closed.
  - **Protocols:** Specify allowed protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP).
  - **Packet Content:** Inspect packet data for malicious content.
- **Configurations:**
  - **Allow:** Permit specific traffic to pass through.
  - **Deny:** Block specific traffic.
  - **Logging:** Record details of traffic that matches certain rules.
  - **Stateful vs. Stateless:**
    - **Stateful:** Keeps track of the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the state of the connection.
    - **Stateless:** Treats each packet in isolation without regard to the state of the connection.

## Security Groups and Network ACLs

### **Security Groups:**

- **Purpose:** Act as virtual firewalls for instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Configuration:**
  - Associated with instances in a virtual network.
  - Rules specify allowed traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
- **Use Case:** Managing traffic to and from virtual machines in cloud environments (e.g., AWS EC2).

### **Network ACLs (Access Control Lists):**

- **Purpose:** Provide a layer of security at the subnet level by controlling traffic entering and exiting a subnet.
- **Configuration:**
  - Rules specify allowed or denied traffic.
  - Apply to all instances within a subnet.
- **Use Case:** Controlling traffic flow at the subnet level in cloud environments (e.g., AWS VPC).

### Quick Reference

#### Firewalls

- **Definition:** Security devices/software controlling network traffic.
- **Function:** Inspects and filters data packets based on rules.

#### Types of Firewalls

- **Network-Based:**

  - Hardware devices.
  - Protect entire networks.
  - Example: Corporate network boundary.

- **Host-Based:**
  - Software applications.
  - Protect individual devices.
  - Example: Server security.

#### Firewall Rules and Configurations

- **Rules:**

  - **Criteria:** IP addresses, ports, protocols, packet content.
  - **Actions:** Allow, deny, log.

- **Configurations:**
  - **Stateful:** Tracks active connections.
  - **Stateless:** Treats each packet independently.

#### Security Groups and Network ACLs

- **Security Groups:**

  - Virtual firewalls for instances.
  - Rules based on IP, protocols, ports.
  - Example: Cloud virtual machines.

- **Network ACLs:**
  - Subnet-level security.
  - Rules apply to all instances in a subnet.
  - Example: Cloud subnets.
