# 1.1 OSI and TCP/IP Models

← Previous || [README](../README.md) || Next →

Understanding the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) models is foundational for networking. These models describe how data is transmitted over a network, breaking the process into layers.

## **OSI Model**

Think of the OSI model as a **stack**, where each layer relies on the services provided by the layer below it.

- When data is sent, it travels **down** through the layers on the **sender's side**, gets transmitted over the physical medium, and then **moves up** through the layers on the **receiver's side**.

```python
             Sender's Side           |             Receiver's Side
  +----------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
  |            Application Layer     |            Application Layer           |
  +----------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
  |           Presentation Layer     |           Presentation Layer           |
  +----------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
  |               Session Layer      |               Session Layer            |
  +----------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
  |               Transport Layer    |               Transport Layer          |
  +----------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
  |                Network Layer     |                Network Layer           |
  +----------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
  |             Data Link Layer      |             Data Link Layer            |
  +----------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
  |             Physical Layer       |             Physical Layer             |
  +----------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
                  |                                          ↑
                  |                                          |
                  v                                          |
  Data travels down on Sender's Side.       Data travels up on the receiver's side.
```

**The OSI model has seven layers, each with specific functions and protocols associated with it:**

1. **Physical Layer**

   - **Function:** Deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables, switches, and other hardware.
   - **Protocols/Technologies:** Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth.

2. **Data Link Layer**

   - **Function:** Manages node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction.
   - **Protocols/Technologies:** Ethernet, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), Switches.

3. **Network Layer**

   - **Function:** Handles routing of data from source to destination across multiple networks.
   - **Protocols/Technologies:** IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), Routers.

4. **Transport Layer**

   - **Function:** Ensures complete data transfer with error recovery and flow control.
   - **Protocols/Technologies:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

5. **Session Layer**

   - **Function:** Manages sessions or connections between applications.
   - **Protocols/Technologies:** NetBIOS, PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol).

6. **Presentation Layer**

   - **Function:** Translates data between the application layer and the network, handling encryption and compression.
   - **Protocols/Technologies:** SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), JPEG, ASCII.

7. **Application Layer**
   - **Function:** Provides network services directly to end-user applications.
   - **Protocols/Technologies:** HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.

## **TCP/IP Model**

The TCP/IP model, which is more straightforward and widely used in real-world networking, has four layers:

1. **Network Interface Layer (Link Layer)**

   - **Function:** Corresponds to the OSI Physical and Data Link layers, dealing with hardware addressing and media access control.
   - **Protocols/Technologies:** Ethernet, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).

2. **Internet Layer**

   - **Function:** Corresponds to the OSI Network layer, managing logical addressing and routing.
   - **Protocols/Technologies:** IP, ICMP.

3. **Transport Layer**

   - **Function:** Corresponds to the OSI Transport layer, providing communication services directly to the application processes running on different hosts.
   - **Protocols/Technologies:** TCP, UDP.

4. **Application Layer**

   - **Function:** Corresponds to the OSI Application, Presentation, and Session layers, facilitating end-user processes and applications.
   - **Protocols/Technologies:** HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.

#### Differences between OSI and TCP/IP Models

- **Number of Layers:** OSI has seven layers, while TCP/IP has four.

- **Development:** OSI is a theoretical model developed by ISO (International Organization for Standardization), while TCP/IP was developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) based on practical requirements.

- **Implementation:** TCP/IP is the basis for the Internet and is widely implemented, whereas OSI is used more for teaching and theoretical purposes.

- **Functionality:** OSI separates the data link and physical layers, and also the presentation and session layers, whereas TCP/IP combines these into fewer layers.

- **Protocols:** OSI doesn't specify protocols; it is a conceptual model. TCP/IP includes specific protocols like IP, TCP, and UDP.
