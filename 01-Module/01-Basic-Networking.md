# 1. Basic Networking Concepts

### 1.1. OSI and TCP/IP Models

#### Understanding the Layers and Their Functions

**OSI Model:**
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols. It has seven layers:

1. **Physical Layer**: Deals with the physical connection between devices and the transmission of binary data over physical mediums (e.g., cables, switches).
2. **Data Link Layer**: Responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction (e.g., Ethernet, MAC addresses).
3. **Network Layer**: Manages data transfer between different networks and routing (e.g., IP addresses, routers).
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures error-free data transfer between devices, provides flow control and reliability (e.g., TCP, UDP).
5. **Session Layer**: Manages sessions or connections between applications (e.g., managing multiple web sessions).
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates data formats between the application and the network (e.g., encryption, data compression).
7. **Application Layer**: Provides network services directly to user applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).

**TCP/IP Model:**
The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is a more practical and simplified version used for real-world networking. It has four layers:

1. **Link Layer**: Combines the Physical and Data Link layers of the OSI model (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
2. **Internet Layer**: Equivalent to the OSI Network Layer, responsible for routing data (e.g., IP).
3. **Transport Layer**: Similar to the OSI Transport Layer, ensuring reliable data transfer (e.g., TCP, UDP).
4. **Application Layer**: Combines the OSI's Application, Presentation, and Session layers, providing application services (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

#### Protocols Associated with Each Layer

**OSI Model Protocols:**

- **Physical Layer**: Ethernet (physical components), USB, Bluetooth
- **Data Link Layer**: Ethernet (MAC), PPP, Switches, Bridges
- **Network Layer**: IP, ICMP, ARP, Routers
- **Transport Layer**: TCP, UDP, SCTP
- **Session Layer**: NetBIOS, PPTP
- **Presentation Layer**: SSL/TLS, JPEG, GIF
- **Application Layer**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SNMP

**TCP/IP Model Protocols:**

- **Link Layer**: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ARP
- **Internet Layer**: IP, ICMP, IGMP
- **Transport Layer**: TCP, UDP
- **Application Layer**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SNMP

#### Difference Between OSI and TCP/IP Models

1. **Layers**: OSI has seven layers, while TCP/IP has four layers.
2. **Development**: OSI is a theoretical model developed first by ISO, while TCP/IP is a practical implementation developed by the Department of Defense (DoD).
3. **Usage**: OSI is used as a reference model for understanding and designing networks, while TCP/IP is used for actual data communication over the internet.
4. **Protocol Independence**: OSI is protocol-independent and general, while TCP/IP is protocol-specific, tailored for the internet.

### 1.2. IP Addressing

#### IPv4 and IPv6

- **IPv4**: Uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. Format: `192.168.1.1`
- **IPv6**: Uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for a vast number of unique addresses. Format: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

#### Subnetting and Supernetting

- **Subnetting**: Dividing a larger network into smaller sub-networks. Helps in efficient IP address management and improves network security and performance.
- **Supernetting**: Combining multiple smaller networks into a larger one. Used primarily for route aggregation and reducing the number of routing table entries.

#### Public vs. Private IP Addresses

- **Public IP Addresses**: Routable on the internet, assigned by ISPs.
- **Private IP Addresses**: Not routable on the internet, used within private networks. Ranges include:
  - Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
  - Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
  - Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

#### CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

- CIDR notation represents IP addresses and their associated routing prefix. Format: `192.168.1.0/24`
- Benefits include efficient IP address allocation and reduced routing table size.

#### NAT (Network Address Translation)

- **NAT**: Translates private IP addresses to a public IP address for internet access.
- Types of NAT:
  - **Static NAT**: One-to-one mapping between private and public IP addresses.
  - **Dynamic NAT**: Multiple private IP addresses mapped to a pool of public IP addresses.
  - **PAT (Port Address Translation)**: Multiple private IP addresses mapped to a single public IP address using different ports.
