# 3.2 Switching

#### Understanding Switches and Their Role

**Switch:**

- A switch is a network device that operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.
- Its primary function is to forward data frames based on MAC addresses.
- Switches are commonly used in local area networks (LANs) to connect devices within the same network segment.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **MAC Address Learning:**

    - Switches learn the MAC addresses of connected devices by examining the source address of incoming frames.
    - This information is then stored in the switch's MAC address table.

2.  **MAC Address Table:**

    - A table maintained by the switch that maps MAC addresses to the corresponding switch ports.
    - Helps the switch make forwarding decisions based on destination MAC addresses.

3.  **Frame Forwarding:**

    - When a switch receives a data frame, it checks the destination MAC address in its MAC address table.
    - If the destination address is known, the switch forwards the frame only to the port where the destination device is located.
    - If the destination address is unknown, the switch broadcasts the frame to all ports except the source port.

#### VLANs and Their Importance in Modern Networks

**VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network):**

- A VLAN is a logical grouping of devices within the same physical network but logically segmented to improve network efficiency, security, and management.

**Importance of VLANs:**

1.  **Efficiency:**

    - Reduces broadcast domains, limiting the scope of broadcast traffic.
    - Enhances network performance by isolating broadcast traffic within VLANs.

2.  **Security:**

    - Isolates traffic between different VLANs, adding a layer of security.
    - Devices in one VLAN cannot directly communicate with devices in another VLAN without the use of routing.

3.  **Flexibility:**

    - Simplifies network management by grouping devices logically rather than physically.
    - Changes to VLAN assignments can be made in software without physically moving devices or rewiring.

4.  **Scalability:**

    - Easier to scale and manage as the network grows.
    - Allows for logical segmentation of a large network into smaller, more manageable segments.
