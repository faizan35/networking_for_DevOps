# 1.3 Subnetting and Supernetting

## Subnetting

- **Subnetting Involves dividing the <u>host portion</u> of IP address to create subnets.**
- **Means,** Divides a larger network into smaller sub-networks (subnets).
- **Benefits:** Improved performance, management, and security.

#### **Example:**

- Original Network: 192.168.1.0/24
- Subnets:
  - 192.168.1.0/26 (Subnet 1)
  - 192.168.1.64/26 (Subnet 2)
  - 192.168.1.128/26 (Subnet 3)
  - 192.168.1.192/26 (Subnet 4)

## Supernetting

- **Purpose:** Combines smaller networks into a larger network.
- **Usage:** Efficient routing and address allocation.
- **Example:**
  - Original Networks: 192.168.0.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24
  - Supernet: 192.168.0.0/23

## Subnet Masks and CIDR Notation

### **Subnet Mask:**

- A subnet mask separates an IP address into network and host portions.
- Example: For a Class C address (e.g., 192.168.1.0), a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 represents a 24-bit network mask.

> **Note :-** CIDR is more efficient way to subnet IP addresses compared to the older class-based addressing system.

### **CIDR Notation:**

- **Purpose:** Simplifies subnetting and supernetting.
- **Format:** IP address followed by a slash and the number of network bits.
- **Examples:**
  - /24 (equivalent to 255.255.255.0)
  - /16 (equivalent to 255.255.0.0)
  - /8 (equivalent to 255.0.0.0)

**Benefits of CIDR:**

- More flexible IP allocation.
- Reduces size of routing tables.
- Facilitates efficient IP address management.

#### Understanding CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):

- Represents IP addresses and their associated routing prefix.
- **Format:** **IP_address/prefix_length**
- **Example:** 192.168.1.0/24 denotes a 24-bit network mask, and 8-bit for host which is for subnetting.
- Enables more flexible allocation of IP addresses compared to traditional class-based addressing.

#### **Steps in Subnetting:**

1.  **Determine the Original CIDR:**

    - Original CIDR: `192.168.10.0/24`

2.  **Decide on the Number of Subnets Needed:**

    - Let's say we want to create **4 subnets**.

3.  **Calculate the New Subnet Mask Length:**

    - Increasing the subnet mask length allows for the creation of more subnets within a given IP address space.

    - Formula for calculating the **number of subnets**.

      ```txt
      2^n >= Number of Subnets.
      ```

      - `n` = number of additional bits required.

    - We know the number of subnet = 4, So `2^2 = 4`.

    - To create 4 subnets, you need at least **2 bits**.

    - So, the new subnet mask length
    - **`/24 (original) + 2 (for subnets) = /26`**

    - **Explanation:**
      - With 1 bit, you have 2 possible values (0 and 1).
      - With 2 bits, you have 2^2 = 4 possible values (00, 01, 10, 11).
      - With 3 bits, you have 2^3 = 8 possible values (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111).
      - And so on.

4.  **Identify Subnet Ranges:**

    - `192.168.10.0` is a Class C IP, traditionally with the format "N.N.N.H" (8 bits for network, 8 bits for network, 8 bits for network, 8 bits for hosts).
    - `2^N = possible values` , N = no of Host bits
    - You have N = 8 (host bits), and 2^8 = 256 possible values.
    - Since you are creating 4 subnets, each subnet will have 256 / 4 = 64 possible values.
    - Start with `192.168.10.0` and increment by 64 for each subsequent subnet.
    - Subnet 1: `192.168.10.0/26`
    - Subnet 2: `192.168.10.64/26`
    - Subnet 3: `192.168.10.128/26`
    - Subnet 4: `192.168.10.192/26`

5.  **Determine Host Ranges in Each Subnet:**

    - The usable host addresses in each subnet are from the range `1` to `62`.
      - Subnet 1: `192.168.10.1` to `192.168.10.62`
      - Subnet 2: `192.168.10.65` to `192.168.10.126`
      - Subnet 3: `192.168.10.129` to `192.168.10.190`
      - Subnet 4: `192.168.10.193` to `192.168.10.254`

    **Explanation:**

    - In each subnet, **subtracting 2 from the total number of addresses** accounts for the **network and broadcast addresses**. This ensures that these addresses are reserved and not used for individual hosts.
    - The first usable address in each subnet starts after the network address, and the last usable address is just before the broadcast address.

6.  **Summary:**

    - **Subnet 1:**

      - Network Address: `192.168.10.0/26`
      - Usable Host Range: `192.168.10.1` to `192.168.10.62`
      - Broadcast Address: `192.168.10.63`

    - **Subnet 2:**

      - Network Address: `192.168.10.64/26`
      - Usable Host Range: `192.168.10.65` to `192.168.10.126`
      - Broadcast Address: `192.168.10.127`

    - **Subnet 3:**

      - Network Address: `192.168.10.128/26`
      - Usable Host Range: `192.168.10.129` to `192.168.10.190`
      - Broadcast Address: `192.168.10.191`

    - **Subnet 4:**

      - Network Address: `192.168.10.192/26`
      - Usable Host Range: `192.168.10.193` to `192.168.10.254`
      - Broadcast Address: `192.168.10.255`

### Quick Reference

#### Subnetting

- **Divides large networks into smaller ones.**

#### Supernetting

- **Combines smaller networks into a larger one.**
- **Example:** 192.168.0.0/24 + 192.168.1.0/24 -> 192.168.0.0/23

#### Subnet Masks and CIDR

- **Defines network and host portions of IP.**
- **Example:** /24 = 255.255.255.0
