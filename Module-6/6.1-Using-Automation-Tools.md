# 6.1 Using Automation Tools

**Definition:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an approach to managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable script files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. In the context of networking, IaC involves automating the configuration and management of network devices and services.

**Automation Tools:**

1.  **Ansible:**

    - **Overview:**
      - Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies the configuration, deployment, and orchestration of IT infrastructure.
    - **Key Features:**
      - Agentless: Does not require installing agents on target devices.
      - Uses YAML syntax for easy-to-read playbooks.
      - Supports a wide range of networking devices and platforms.
    - **Use Case:**
      - Automating the configuration of network devices, such as routers and switches.

2.  **Puppet:**

    - **Overview:**
      - Puppet is a configuration management tool that automates the provisioning and management of infrastructure.
    - **Key Features:**
      - Uses a declarative language to define the desired state of systems.
      - Agent-based architecture for managing nodes.
      - Extensive module ecosystem for various configurations.
    - **Use Case:**
      - Managing and maintaining consistent configurations across a network.

3.  **Chef:**

    - **Overview:**
      - Chef is an automation platform that uses code to manage infrastructure as code.
    - **Key Features:**
      - Employs a declarative language called "recipes" to define configurations.
      - Supports a client-server architecture for managing nodes.
      - Has a large community-driven cookbook repository.
    - **Use Case:**
      - Automating the deployment and configuration of network services.

**Writing Playbooks for Network Configuration:**

1.  **Ansible Playbooks:**

    - **YAML Syntax:**

      - Ansible playbooks use YAML syntax for defining configurations.
      - Example:

        ```yaml
        ---
        - name: Configure Network
        hosts: network_devices
        tasks:
            - name: Ensure NTP is configured
            ios_config:
                lines:
                - ntp server 10.0.0.1
            notify:
                - Save Configuration
            - name: Ensure VLAN is created
            ios_vlan:
                vlan_id: 100
                name: DataVLAN
        ```

2.  **Puppet Manifests:**

    - **Declarative Language:**

      - Puppet uses a declarative language to define the desired state of systems.
      - Example:

        ```puppet
        node 'router.example.com' {
        include network_router
        }
        ```

3.  **Chef Recipes:**

    - **Declarative Language:**

      - Chef recipes use a declarative language to define configurations.
      - Example:

        ```ruby
        # Cookbook:: network
        # Recipe:: configure_router
        router 'my_router' do
        action :configure
        ntp_server '10.0.0.1'
        vlan_id 100
        vlan_name 'DataVLAN'
        end
        ```

**Key Concepts in Playbook Development:**

1.  **Hosts and Groups:**

    - Define target hosts or groups in playbooks to specify where the configurations should be applied.

2.  **Tasks:**

    - Define tasks that describe the steps to be performed on the target hosts. Each task is associated with a specific module that performs the action.

3.  **Handlers:**

    - Handlers are tasks triggered by other tasks. They are typically used for actions that should be performed only when changes are made.

4.  **Variables:**

    - Use variables to define reusable values that can be dynamically applied based on different scenarios.

5.  **Modules:**

    - Modules are units of work in automation tools that perform specific actions on the target hosts (e.g., installing a package, configuring a service).

Implementing Infrastructure as Code for networking using automation tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef streamlines the configuration management process, ensures consistency, and reduces manual errors. Writing playbooks or manifests allows network administrators to define and version the desired state of network devices and services.
