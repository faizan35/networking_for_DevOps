# 7.2 Custom Networks in Docker

### **Creating and Utilizing Custom Bridge Networks:**

- Custom bridge networks provide improved control and isolation for container communication.
- Use the `docker network create` command to create a custom bridge network:

  ```bash
  docker network create my_custom_network
  ```

- Containers can be attached to this custom network during creation.

### **Communication Between Containers in User-Defined Bridge Networks:**

- Containers on the same user-defined bridge network can communicate with each other.
- Use the `--network` option during container creation to connect a container to a specific network:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name container1 --network my_custom_network my_image
  docker run -d --name container2 --network my_custom_network my_image
  ```

- Containers can communicate using container names as DNS names.

### **Use of Container Names for Intra-Network Communication:**

- Containers within the same network can use container names as hostnames for communication.
- This simplifies communication between containers without relying on explicit IP addresses.

#### Example Scenario:

Let's create a custom bridge network named **"my_app_network"** and connect two containers to this network:

```bash
# Create a custom bridge network
docker network create my_app_network
```

```bash
# Run a container named "web_server" and connect it to the custom network
docker run -d --name web_server --network my_app_network my_web_image

# Run a container named "database_server" and connect it to the custom network
docker run -d --name database_server --network my_app_network my_database_image
```

Containers on the "my_app_network" can communicate using container names:

```bash
# From web_server container, ping the database_server
docker exec -it web_server ping database_server
```

```bash
# From database_server container, ping the web_server
docker exec -it database_server ping web_server
```
