# 1.2 IP Addressing

## IPv4 and IPv6

### **IPv4**

- **Format:** 32-bit address written in decimal format, divided into four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **Address Space:** Approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
- **Structure:** Each octet ranges from 0 to 255.

**Advantages:**

- Widespread adoption and familiarity.
- Compatibility with a vast majority of existing networks and devices.

**Disadvantages:**

- Limited address space, leading to address exhaustion.
- Requires NAT, which can complicate network configuration and management.

#### **IPv6**

- **Format:** 128-bit address written in hexadecimal format, divided into eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- **Address Space:** Vastly larger than IPv4, with 340 undecillion unique addresses.
- **Structure:** Groups are separated by colons.

**Advantages:**

- Vast address space eliminates address exhaustion.
- Simplifies network configuration with direct addressing.
- Improved support for modern network applications and technologies.

**Disadvantages:**

- Gradual adoption and transition from IPv4.
- Compatibility issues with older systems and applications.

### Why Transition from IPv4 to IPv6?

1. **Address Exhaustion:**

   - **IPv4:** Limited to 4.3 billion addresses, which are insufficient for the rapidly growing number of internet-connected devices.
   - **IPv6:** Provides 340 undecillion addresses, ensuring no shortage.

2. **Network Complexity:**

   - **IPv4:** Requires NAT to extend the address space, adding complexity and potential performance bottlenecks.
   - **IPv6:** Eliminates the need for NAT, allowing simpler and more efficient routing.

3. **Security:**

   - **IPv4:** Security features (e.g., IPsec) are optional.
   - **IPv6:** Security is built-in with mandatory support for IPsec.

4. **Performance:**
   - **IPv4:** Limited address space can lead to fragmented and inefficient routing.
   - **IPv6:** Larger address space and improved features can lead to more efficient routing and data handling.

## **Classes of IP Addresses**

**IPv4 Address Classes:**
IPv4 addresses are divided into five classes (A, B, C, D, E), primarily based on the leading bits.

1.  **Class A:**

    - **Range:** 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255
    - **Format:** N.H.H.H (Network.Host.Host.Host)
    - **Example:** 10.0.0.1
    - **Subnet Mask:** 255.0.0.0 (or /8 in CIDR notation).
    - **Notes:** Intended for large networks with a massive number of hosts.

2.  **Class B:**

    - **Range:** 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
    - **Format:** N.N.H.H
    - **Example:** 172.16.0.1
    - **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.0.0 (or /16 in CIDR notation).
    - **Notes:** Suitable for medium-sized networks.

3.  **Class C:**

    - **Range:** 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
    - **Format:** N.N.N.H
    - **Example:** 192.168.1.1
    - **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0 (or /24 in CIDR notation).
    - **Notes:** Intended for smaller networks with a limited number of hosts.

4.  **Class D:**

    - **Range:** 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.
    - **Usage:** Reserved for multicast groups.

5.  **Class E:**
    - **Range:** 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.
    - **Usage:** Reserved for experimental purposes.

#### **How a person thinks of a IP Address**

1.  **Identifying IP Address Class:**

    - When you look at an IP address, you can tell its class (A, B, or C) based on the range of the first octet.
    - Now you know how much is network portion and host portion. (done by **subnet mask**)

2.  **Network Portion:**

    - Identifies the network to which a device belongs.
    - Helps routers route data to the correct network.

3.  **Host Portion:**

    - Identifies a specific device within a network.
    - Can be further subdivided for more efficient organization through techniques like **subnetting**.

4.  **Subnetting:** Involves dividing the **host portion** to create subnets.

So, after looking at an IP address:

- The class tells you how it's structured (network vs. host portions).
- The network portion tells you what network the device is on.
- The host portion tells you which specific device in that network.

## Private vs. Public IP Addresses

### **Public IP Addresses:**

- **Usage:** Routable on the internet and must be unique globally.
- **Assignment:** Assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and managed by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).
- **Examples:** 8.8.8.8 (Google's DNS server).

### **Private IP Addresses:**

- **Usage:** Used within private networks and not routable on the internet. They allow multiple devices within a local network to communicate.
- **Ranges:**
  - **Class A:** 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255.
  - **Class B:** 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255.
  - **Class C:** 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.
- **Example:** 192.168.1.1 (common home router IP address).

## NAT (Network Address Translation)

**Purpose:**

- Translates private IP addresses to a public IP address.
- Conserves public IP addresses.
- Enhances security by hiding internal network details.

**Types:**

1. **Static NAT:** One-to-one mapping.
   - Example: Internal IP 192.168.1.10 -> Public IP 203.0.113.10.
2. **Dynamic NAT:** Many-to-many mapping using a pool of public IPs.
   - Example: Internal IP 192.168.1.10 -> One of available public IPs.
3. **PAT (Port Address Translation):** Many-to-one mapping using different ports.
   - Example: Internal IPs 192.168.1.10, 192.168.1.11 -> Public IP 203.0.113.10:1024, 203.0.113.10:1025.

**Benefits:**

- Efficient use of public IP addresses.
- Improved security.
- Simplifies network management.
