# 2.4. Network Services

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- DHCP is a network protocol that automates the process of assigning IP addresses and other network configuration information to devices on a network.

### **How DHCP Works:**

1. **DHCP Discovery:**
   - A new device (client) connects to the network and broadcasts a DHCP Discover message to find a DHCP server.
2. **DHCP Offer:**
   - A DHCP server receives the Discover message and responds with a DHCP Offer, offering an IP address and other network configuration details.
3. **DHCP Request:**
   - The client responds to the server with a DHCP Request, indicating it accepts the offered IP address.
4. **DHCP Acknowledgment:**
   - The DHCP server sends a DHCP Acknowledgment, finalizing the lease and allowing the client to use the IP address and provided configurations.

### **DHCP Leases and Options:**

- **DHCP Lease:**
  - **Definition:** A temporary assignment of an IP address to a client.
  - **Lease Time:** The duration for which the IP address is assigned. It can be renewed or released.
- **DHCP Options:**
  - **Definition:** Additional configuration parameters provided by the DHCP server, such as DNS server addresses, default gateway, and subnet mask.

## NTP (Network Time Protocol)

**Purpose:**

- Synchronizes the clocks of computers and network devices to a precise time reference.

**How NTP Works:**

1. **Client Request:**
   - The NTP client sends a request to an NTP server for the current time.
2. **Server Response:**
   - The NTP server responds with the precise time, usually coordinated to a reference clock such as an atomic clock.
3. **Synchronization:**
   - The client adjusts its local clock to match the received time.

**NTP Characteristics:**

- **Stratum Levels:**
  - **Stratum 0:** Highly accurate reference clocks (e.g., atomic clocks, GPS clocks).
  - **Stratum 1:** Servers directly connected to Stratum 0 devices.
  - **Stratum 2:** Servers synchronized to Stratum 1 servers, and so on.
- **Hierarchical:** NTP operates in a hierarchical manner, with each stratum synchronizing from the one above.

### Quick Reference

#### DHCP

- **How It Works:**
  1. **Discover:** Client broadcasts to find a DHCP server.
  2. **Offer:** Server offers an IP address.
  3. **Request:** Client requests the offered IP.
  4. **Acknowledge:** Server acknowledges and assigns the IP.
- **Leases and Options:**
  - **Lease:** Temporary IP assignment (renewable).
  - **Options:** Additional settings (DNS, gateway).

#### NTP

- **Purpose:** Time synchronization for network devices.
- **How It Works:**
  1. **Request:** Client asks for time.
  2. **Response:** Server provides precise time.
  3. **Sync:** Client adjusts its clock.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Stratum Levels:** Hierarchical time source structure.
  - **Stratum 0:** Reference clocks (e.g., atomic).
  - **Stratum 1:** Servers connected to Stratum 0.
  - **Stratum 2:** Servers synchronized to Stratum 1.

This summary of DHCP and NTP provides a clear and concise understanding of these essential network services, making it easy to remember how they function and their key characteristics.
