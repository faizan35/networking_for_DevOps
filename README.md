- Protocols associated with each layer
- Difference between OSI and TCP/IP models.

### 1.2. **IP Addressing**

- IPv4 and IPv6
- Subnetting and Supernetting
- Public vs. private IP addresses
- CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing).
- NAT (Network Address Translation)

### 1.3. **DNS (Domain Name System)**

- How DNS works
- Types of DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, PTR, etc.)
- DNS resolution process

### 1.4. **MAC Addressing**

- Understanding MAC addresses
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

## 2. Network Protocols

### 2.1. **Common Network Protocols**

- HTTP/HTTPS
- FTP/SFTP/FTPS
- SSH
- SMTP/IMAP/POP3
- SNMP

### 2.2. **TCP/UDP**

- Differences between TCP and UDP.
- Common TCP and UDP ports and their uses.

### 2.3. **Routing and Switching**

- Basics of routers and switches
- Static vs. dynamic routing
- Common routing protocols (OSPF, BGP, etc.)

### 2.4. **Network Services**

- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):
  - How DHCP works.
  - DHCP leases and options.
- NTP (Network Time Protocol)

## 3. Network Devices and Components

### 3.1. **Routers and Switches:**

- Functionality and configuration basics.
- Routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP).

### 3.2. **Firewalls:**

- How firewalls work
- Types of firewalls (network-based, host-based).
- Firewall rules and configurations.
- security groups and network ACLs

### 3.3. **Load Balancers:**

- Layer 4 vs. Layer 7
- Types of load balancers (hardware, software, cloud-based).
- Load balancing algorithms (round-robin, least connections, etc.).

## 4. Network Security

### 4.1. **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**

- Types of VPNs (site-to-site, remote access)
- VPN protocols (IPsec, SSL/TLS)

### 4.2. **Proxy Servers**

- Forward proxy vs. reverse proxy
- Use cases for proxies

### 4.3. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**

- Understanding IDS and IPS.
- Difference between detection and prevention.

### 4.4. **Network Segmentation:**

## 5. Cloud Networking

### 5.1. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**

- VPC setup and configuration
- Subnets, route tables, and gateways

2. **Security Groups and Network ACLs**

   - Configuring and managing security groups
   - Network ACLs (Access Control Lists) in cloud environments

3. **Load Balancers in the Cloud**

   - Cloud-specific load balancing services (e.g., AWS ELB, Azure Load Balancer)

4. **DNS Services in the Cloud**
   - Cloud DNS services (e.g., Route 53, Azure DNS)

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

1. **Network Monitoring Tools**

   - Common tools (Wireshark, tcpdump, Nagios, etc.)
   - Network performance metrics

2. **Troubleshooting Techniques**
   - Analyzing network traffic
   - Diagnosing and resolving network issues

### Practical Skills

1. **Shell Scripting for Network Management**

   - Automating network tasks with scripts

2. **Configuring and Managing Network Devices**

   - Basic configuration of routers, switches, and firewalls

3. **Using Cloud Provider Networking Tools**
   - Managing cloud networking components through the cloud provider's console and CLI

By mastering these concepts and skills, you'll be well-prepared for a DevOps Engineer role with a strong foundation in networking.

   - VPC configuration and components (subnets, route tables, internet gateways).
   - Security groups and network ACLs.

2. **Hybrid Cloud Connectivity:**

   - Direct Connect (AWS), ExpressRoute (Azure), Cloud Interconnect (GCP).

3. **DNS Services:**
   - Cloud DNS services (Route 53, Azure DNS, Cloud DNS).

### **Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting**

1. **Network Monitoring Tools:**

   - Tools like Nagios, Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana.

2. **Packet Analysis:**

   - Tools like Wireshark for packet capture and analysis.

3. **Troubleshooting Techniques:**
   - Common network troubleshooting commands (ping, traceroute, netstat, nslookup, dig).

### **Scripting and Automation**

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

   - Using tools like Terraform, Ansible for network configuration management.

2. **Network Automation:**

   - Scripting for network automation (Python, Bash).

3. **Configuration Management:**
   - Tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef for managing network device configurations.

Understanding these networking concepts and technologies will be essential for a DevOps Engineer role, enabling you to design, deploy, and manage reliable and secure network infrastructure.
