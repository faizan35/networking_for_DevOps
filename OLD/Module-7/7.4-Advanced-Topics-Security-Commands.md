# 7.4: Advanced Topics, Security, and Commands

### **Docker Compose for Defining Multi-Container Applications:**

- Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- Use YAML files to specify the services, networks, and volumes for a multi-container application.
- Example `docker-compose.yml` file:

  ```yaml
  version: "3"
  services:
  web_app:
    image: my_web_app_image
    networks:
      - custom_network
  database:
    image: my_database_image
    networks:
      - custom_network
  networks:
  custom_network:
  ```

### **Third-Party Network Plugins and Their Applications:**

- Docker supports third-party network plugins to extend networking capabilities.
- Plugins provide additional features, such as advanced network segmentation and integration with external networking solutions.
- Plugins can be installed and configured based on specific use cases.

### **Security Considerations in Docker Networking:**

- Implement network segmentation to isolate sensitive services and prevent unauthorized access.
- Use encrypted overlay networks for secure communication between containers, especially in distributed environments.

### Docker Networking Commands:

- `docker network ls`: List available networks.
- `docker network create`: Create a new network.
- `docker network connect`: Connect a container to a network.
- `docker network disconnect`: Disconnect a container from a network.
- `docker network inspect`: Display detailed information about a network.
- `docker network rm`: Remove one or more networks.
- `docker network prune`: Remove all unused networks.
- `docker network inspect --format '{{json .Name}}' $(docker network ls -q)`: List network names in JSON format.
- `docker network inspect --format '{{range .IPAM.Config}}{{.Subnet}}{{end}}' <network-name>`: Display the subnet of a specific network.
- `docker network inspect --format '{{json .Containers}}' <network-name>`: Show containers connected to a network in JSON format.

#### Example Scenario:

Let's use Docker Compose to define a multi-container application consisting of a web app and a database, both connected to a custom network:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  web_app:
    image: my_web_app_image
    networks:
      - custom_network
  database:
    image: my_database_image
    networks:
      - custom_network
networks:
  custom_network:
```

Save the above content in a file named `docker-compose.yml` and then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This creates and starts the defined services in the background.
