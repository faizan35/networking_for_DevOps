# 7.1 Introduction and Basics of Docker Networking

### **Overview of Docker:**

- Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into containers.
- Containers are lightweight, portable, and can run consistently across different environments.

### **Importance of Networking in Containerized Environments:**

- Networking in containerized environments is crucial for enabling communication between containers, facilitating service discovery, and managing how containers connect to external networks.

### **Basics of Container Communication Within a Host:**

- Containers on the same host can communicate with each other over the loopback interface (**localhost**).
- Containers share the host's network namespace, but they have their own isolated filesystem and process namespace.

### **Understanding the Default Bridge Network:**

- Docker uses a default bridge network to connect containers on the same host.
- Containers connected to the default bridge network can communicate with each other using internal IP addresses assigned by Docker.
- By default, containers on the default bridge network are isolated from the host and external network.

#### Example Scenario:

Suppose you have two containers, **"web_app"** and **"database"**, running on the same host. Docker automatically assigns internal IP addresses to each container on the default bridge network.

```bash
# Start the web_app container
docker run -d --name web_app my_web_app_image

# Start the database container
docker run -d --name database my_database_image
```

**Containers can communicate with each other using their internal IP addresses:**

- Web App to Database:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it web_app ping database
  ```

- Database to Web App:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it database ping web_app
  ```
