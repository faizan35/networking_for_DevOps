### 4.3. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

#### Understanding IDS and IPS

**Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**

- **Definition:** A device or software application that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and known threats, alerting administrators to potential intrusions.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Passive System:** Monitors and analyzes network traffic, but does not take direct action to stop an attack.
  - **Detection Capabilities:** Can detect a variety of attacks, such as malware, exploits, and policy violations.
  - **Alerting:** Generates alerts or logs when suspicious activity is detected, allowing administrators to investigate and respond.

**Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):**

- **Definition:** Similar to IDS, but extends its functionality by actively preventing or blocking detected threats.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Active System:** Monitors and analyzes network traffic and takes action to prevent or block suspicious activity.
  - **Prevention Capabilities:** Can drop malicious packets, terminate connections, or block traffic from specific IP addresses.
  - **Real-Time Response:** Provides immediate response to threats, reducing the risk of successful attacks.

#### Difference Between Detection and Prevention

- **Detection (IDS):**

  - **Function:** Identifies and alerts on potential security breaches.
  - **Action:** Does not block or prevent attacks; instead, it logs and alerts administrators.
  - **Response:** Requires manual intervention from administrators to investigate and mitigate threats.
  - **Example:** An IDS detecting and alerting on an unusual spike in network traffic that may indicate a DDoS attack.

- **Prevention (IPS):**
  - **Function:** Identifies and actively blocks or mitigates potential security breaches.
  - **Action:** Automatically takes steps to prevent attacks, such as dropping malicious packets or blocking traffic.
  - **Response:** Provides automatic, real-time response to threats, reducing the need for manual intervention.
  - **Example:** An IPS detecting and blocking incoming traffic from a known malicious IP address attempting to exploit a vulnerability.

### Quick Reference

#### IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

- **Definition:** Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Passive monitoring.
  - Detects attacks and policy violations.
  - Generates alerts and logs.
- **Example:** Alerts on unusual network traffic spikes.

#### IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)

- **Definition:** Monitors and actively blocks suspicious activity.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Active monitoring and prevention.
  - Blocks malicious packets and traffic.
  - Provides real-time response.
- **Example:** Blocks traffic from known malicious IPs.

#### Difference Between Detection and Prevention

- **Detection (IDS):**

  - Identifies potential breaches.
  - Alerts administrators.
  - Requires manual response.
  - Example: Alerts on potential DDoS attacks.

- **Prevention (IPS):**
  - Blocks potential breaches.
  - Automatically takes preventive action.
  - Provides real-time response.
  - Example: Blocks malicious traffic automatically.
