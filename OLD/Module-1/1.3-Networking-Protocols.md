# Networking Protocols & Ports

## 1.3.1 Common Protocols

### What do you mean by Protocol?

- Protocol is a set of **rules** and conventions that define **how data is communicated** and exchanged between devices on a network or in a system.
- It ensures standardized and efficient communication by specifying the format, sequencing, and error handling of data during transmission.

1.  **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):**

    - **Purpose:** Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication between devices.
    - **Key Features:** Error checking, retransmission of lost data, and sequencing of data.
    - **Use Case:** Web browsing, email, file transfer.

2.  **Internet Protocol (IP):**

    - **Purpose:** Enables the routing and addressing of data packets across networks.
    - **Key Features:** Logical addressing (IPv4 or IPv6), packet forwarding, and fragmentation.
    - **Use Case:** All internet communication relies on IP.

3.  **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):**

    - **Purpose:** Facilitates the transfer of hypertext (web pages) over the internet.
    - **Key Features:** Stateless communication, uses TCP.
    - **Use Case:** Web browsing.

4.  **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS):**

    - **Purpose:** Secured version of HTTP using encryption.
    - **Key Features:** Adds a layer of security with SSL/TLS encryption.
    - **Use Case:** Secure online transactions, confidential communications.

5.  **File Transfer Protocol (FTP):**

    - **Purpose:** Allows the transfer of files between devices on a network.
    - **Key Features:** Supports upload and download of files.
    - **Use Case:** Uploading website content, file sharing.

6.  **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP):**

    - **Purpose:** Manages the sending of emails between servers.
    - **Key Features:** Text-based protocol for email transmission.
    - **Use Case:** Sending emails.

7.  **Post Office Protocol (POP):**

    - **Purpose:** Retrieves emails from a server to a client.
    - **Key Features:** Downloads emails to the client device.
    - **Use Case:** Retrieving emails from a server.

8.  **Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP):**

    - **Purpose:** Similar to POP but allows multiple devices to access and manage the same mailbox.
    - **Key Features:** Keeps emails on the server, supports folders and flags.
    - **Use Case:** Managing emails across multiple devices.

9.  **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):**

    - **Purpose:** Automates the assignment of IP addresses and network configuration to devices.
    - **Key Features:** Dynamic allocation of IP addresses.
    - **Use Case:** Simplifies network configuration for devices.

10. **Domain Name System (DNS):**

    - **Purpose:** Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
    - **Key Features:** Hierarchical system for domain naming.
    - **Use Case:** Resolving domain names to IP addresses.

11. **Secure Shell (SSH):**

    - **Purpose:** Provides secure access to remote systems over a potentially unsecured network.
    - **Key Features:** Encrypted communication, secure login, and remote command execution.
    - **Use Case:** Remote server administration, secure file transfer.

12. **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2) and HTTP/3:**

    - **Purpose:** Enhancements over HTTP for faster and more efficient web communication.
    - **Key Features:** Multiplexing, header compression, and improved security.
    - **Use Case:** Web applications, APIs, and microservices.

13. **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP):**

    - **Purpose:** Manages and monitors network devices and their functions.
    - **Key Features:** Standardized framework for network management.
    - **Use Case:** Network monitoring, performance management.

    - **Key Features:** Graphical user interface access to a remote computer.
    - **Use Case:** Remote server administration, troubleshooting.

15. **File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS) and Secure Copy (SCP):**

    - **Purpose:** Secure alternatives to FTP for file transfer.
    - **Key Features:** Encrypted file transfer.
    - **Use Case:** Secure file transfer, backup.

16. **Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP):**

    - **Purpose:** Simple protocol for transferring files without user authentication.
    - **Key Features:** Minimalistic file transfer.
    - **Use Case:** Network booting, configuration updates.

17. **Version Control Protocols (e.g., Git, SVN):**

    - **Purpose:** Manages and tracks changes to source code.
    - **Key Features:** Branching, merging, version history.
    - **Use Case:** Code collaboration, version control.

18. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Protocols:**

    - **Purpose:** Automates the building, testing, and deployment of software.
    - **Key Features:** Integration with CI/CD tools.
    - **Use Case:** Automated software delivery pipelines.

19. **Representational State Transfer (REST) and GraphQL:**

    - **Purpose:** Architectural styles for designing networked applications.
    - **Key Features:** Stateless communication (REST), efficient query language (GraphQL).
    - **Use Case:** API development, microservices.

20. **Container Orchestration Protocols (e.g., Docker API, Kubernetes API):**

    - **Purpose:** Manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of containers.
    - **Key Features:** Container lifecycle management, orchestration.
    - **Use Case:** Containerized application deployment, scaling.

## 1.3.2 Common Ports

### What do you mean by Ports?

- A **"port"** is like a numbered gateway that allows data to flow in and out of a device.
