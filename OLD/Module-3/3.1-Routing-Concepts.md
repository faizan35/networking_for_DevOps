# 3.1 Routing Concepts

#### Basics of Routing

- Routing is the process of directing data packets between different networks to ensure that data reaches its intended destination.
- This is achieved by making decisions based on logical addresses (such as IP addresses).
- Routers are the devices that perform routing functions.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Router:**

    - A networking device that operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
    - Connects different networks and forwards data packets between them.
    - Uses **routing tables** to determine the best path for data transmission.

2.  **Routing:**

    - The process of selecting the optimal path for data to travel from the source to the destination.
    - Involves making decisions based on logical addressing (IP addresses) rather than physical addresses (MAC addresses).

#### Routing Tables and How They Work

**Routing Table:**

- A routing table is a data structure stored in a router that contains information about known routes to reach specific networks or destinations.

**Components of a Routing Table:**

1.  **Network Address:**

    - Identifies the destination network or host.

2.  **Next-Hop Router:**

    - Specifies the router or next-hop interface to which the data packet should be forwarded.

3.  **Metric:**

    - Represents the cost or distance associated with a particular route.
    - The lower the metric, the more preferred the route.

**How Routing Tables Work:**

1.  **Packet Arrival:**

    - When a router receives a data packet, it checks the destination IP address of the packet.

2.  **Routing Table Lookup:**

    - The router looks up the destination IP address in its routing table to find the appropriate route.

3.  **Next-Hop Determination:**

    - The routing table provides information about the next-hop router or interface for forwarding the packet.

4.  **Forwarding the Packet:**

    - The router forwards the packet to the determined next-hop router or interface.

**Static vs. Dynamic Routing:**

1.  **Static Routing:**

    - **Manual Configuration:**
      - Routes are manually configured by a network administrator.
    - **Use Case:**
      - Suitable for small networks with a relatively stable topology.
    - **Advantages:**
      - Simple to set up.
    - **Disadvantages:**
      - Requires manual intervention for updates.

2.  **Dynamic Routing:**

    - **Automated Configuration:**
      - Routers use routing protocols to exchange information and dynamically update routing tables.
    - **Use Case:**
      - Suitable for larger networks with dynamic changes in topology.
    - **Advantages:**
      - Adapts to changes in network topology.
    - **Disadvantages:**
      - More complex to set up compared to static routing.
