# 8.2 Cloud Providers (AWS)

### **Basics of Cloud Networking:**

- **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**

  - **Definition:**
    - A logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources.
  - **Key Concepts:**
    - Allows customization of network configuration, including IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.
    - Provides control over the virtual networking environment, such as creating public and private subnets.

- **Subnetting in AWS:**

  - **Definition:**
    - Dividing a VPC's IP address range into subnets for better resource organization and security.
  - **Key Concepts:**
    - Subnets are associated with specific availability zones (AZs) within a region.
    - Enables the creation of isolated network segments for different purposes, such as public and private subnets.

- **Security Groups:**

  - **Definition:**
    - Acts as a virtual firewall for Amazon EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.
  - **Key Concepts:**
    - Rules are defined based on IP protocols, ports, and source/destination IP addresses.
    - Provides granular control over traffic, allowing or denying specific types of communication.

### **Example Scenario:**

Let's create a basic VPC in AWS with public and private subnets, and configure security groups for instances in the VPC.

1.  **Create a VPC:**

    ```bash
    aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16
    ```

2.  **Create Public and Private Subnets:**

    ```bash
    # Create a public subnet
    aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/24 --availability-zone <az-1> --map-public-ip-on-launch

    # Create a private subnet
    aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/24 --availability-zone <az-2>
    ```

3.  **Create Security Groups:**

    ```bash
    # Create a security group for web servers in the public subnet
    aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name web-sg --description "Web Security Group" --vpc-id <vpc-id>

    # Create a security group for database servers in the private subnet
    aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name db-sg --description "Database Security Group" --vpc-id <vpc-id>
    ```

### **Key Concepts:**

1.  **Amazon VPC:**

    - Provides a virtual network environment for AWS resources.
    - Allows customization of network settings, including subnets and route tables.

2.  **Subnetting in AWS:**

    - Divides a VPC's IP address range into subnets for organization and security.
    - Subnets are associated with specific availability zones.

3.  **Security Groups:**

    - Acts as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances.
    - Controls inbound and outbound traffic based on defined rules.
