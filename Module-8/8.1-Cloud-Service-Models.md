# 8.1 Cloud Service Models

### **IaaS, PaaS, SaaS:**

1.  **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**

    - **Definition:**
      - Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
    - **Key Characteristics:**
      - Users have control over the operating systems, applications, and network configurations.
      - Examples include virtual machines, storage, and networking components.
      - Users are responsible for managing and maintaining the virtualized infrastructure.

2.  **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**

    - **Definition:**
      - Offers a platform that allows customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexities of infrastructure.
    - **Key Characteristics:**
      - Users focus on application development and deployment, while the underlying infrastructure is abstracted.
      - Provides a framework for building, testing, and deploying applications.
      - Examples include databases, development frameworks, and application hosting services.

3.  **Software as a Service (SaaS):**

    - **Definition:**
      - Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
    - **Key Characteristics:**
      - Users access the software through a web browser without worrying about underlying infrastructure.
      - Applications are centrally hosted and managed by the service provider.
      - Examples include email services, customer relationship management (CRM), and office productivity suites.

### **Networking in the Cloud:**

- **Key Components:**

  1.  **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**

      - A logically isolated section of the cloud where you can launch resources.
      - Allows customization of network configuration, including IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways.

  2.  **Subnetting:**

      - Dividing a VPC's IP address range into subnets for better resource organization and security.
      - Subnets are associated with specific availability zones.

  3.  **Security Groups:**

      - Acts as a virtual firewall for instances in a VPC, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
      - Rules are defined based on IP protocols, ports, and source/destination IP addresses.

- **Importance of Cloud Networking:**

  - Enables seamless communication and connectivity between different cloud services and resources.
  - Provides flexibility in configuring and customizing network settings based on specific requirements.
  - Facilitates secure and efficient data transfer within and across cloud environments.
