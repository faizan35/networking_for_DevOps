# 1.4. DNS (Domain Name System)

## How DNS Works

**Purpose:**

- Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1).

**Process:**

1. **User Request:** A user types a domain name into a browser.
2. **Recursive Resolver:** The browser sends the request to a DNS resolver (often provided by an ISP).
3. **Root Server:** If the resolver doesn't have the answer, it queries a root DNS server.
4. **TLD Server:** The root server directs the resolver to the appropriate Top-Level Domain (TLD) server (e.g., .com, .net).
5. **Authoritative Server:** The TLD server directs the resolver to the authoritative DNS server for the domain.
6. **Response:** The authoritative server responds with the IP address.
7. **Caching:** The resolver caches the information for future requests and sends the IP address back to the user’s browser.
8. **Connection:** The browser connects to the IP address and loads the website.

#### Types of DNS Records

1. **A (Address):**

   - **Purpose:** Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
   - **Example:** `example.com IN A 192.0.2.1`

2. **AAAA (IPv6 Address):**

   - **Purpose:** Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
   - **Example:** `example.com IN AAAA 2001:db8::1`

3. **CNAME (Canonical Name):**

   - **Purpose:** Alias for another domain name.
   - **Example:** `www.example.com IN CNAME example.com`

4. **MX (Mail Exchange):**

   - **Purpose:** Specifies mail servers for a domain.
   - **Example:** `example.com IN MX 10 mail.example.com`

5. **PTR (Pointer):**

   - **Purpose:** Maps an IP address to a domain name (reverse DNS).
   - **Example:** `1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa IN PTR example.com`

6. **NS (Name Server):**

   - **Purpose:** Specifies the authoritative DNS servers for a domain.
   - **Example:** `example.com IN NS ns1.example.com`

7. **SOA (Start of Authority):**

   - **Purpose:** Provides administrative information about the zone.
   - **Example:** `example.com IN SOA ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2021010100 7200 3600 1209600 3600`

8. **TXT (Text):**
   - **Purpose:** Holds arbitrary text data, often for verification.
   - **Example:** `example.com IN TXT "v=spf1 include:_spf.example.com ~all"`

### DNS Resolution Story

**Once upon a time in the land of the Internet...**

1. Emma decides to visit her favorite website, so she types the domain name into her browser. **(User Request)**

2. Emma's browser sends this request to a friendly neighborhood librarian called **Resolver**. The librarian is like a super-detective who knows where to find information. **(DNS Resolver)**

3. If the librarian doesn't know the answer immediately, they ask the **Root Sage**, the oldest and wisest of all. **(Root Server)**

4. **TLD Guardian:** The Root Sage points them to the **TLD Guardian**, who manages the top-level domains like .com and .net. **(TLD Server)**

5. **The Domain’s Keeper:** The TLD Guardian then directs the librarian to the **Domain’s Keeper**, who knows everything about the specific domain Emma wants to visit. **(Authoritative Server)**

6. **The Magical Map:** The Domain’s Keeper hands over a magical map (the IP address) that shows the exact location of the website. **(IP Response)**

7. **The Librarian’s Notebook:** The librarian writes down this magical map in their notebook so they can quickly find it next time. **(Caching)**

8. **Emma’s Adventure:** Armed with the magical map, Emma’s browser finally travels to the website and loads it for her to enjoy. **(Connection)**

### Summary

1. **Emma Types** - User Request
2. **Librarian Asks** - DNS Resolver
3. **Root Sage** - Root Server
4. **TLD Guardian** - TLD Server
5. **Domain’s Keeper** - Authoritative Server
